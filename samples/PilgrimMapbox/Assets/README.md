# Pilgrim Mapbox

This demo project shows how to integrate the PilgrimUnitySDK into an application which also uses the Mapbox [package](https://www.mapbox.com/unity/).
To run the project open this directory in Unity, then open `Assets/PilgrimMapbox/Scenes/MapScene.unity`, then follow the directions in [Application Setup](https://github.com/foursquare/pilgrim-unity-sdk#application-setup). Additionally, you will need to register for a Mapbox [access token](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/). You can setup the project to use the token in the menu item `Mapbox > Setup`.
